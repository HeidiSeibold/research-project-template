# Research Project Template

This repository contains a template folder structure for a research project.

```
.
├── README.md
├── analysis
│   └── src
├── comm
│   ├── internal-comm
│   └── journal-comm
├── data
│   ├── data_clean
│   └── data_raw
├── dissemination
│   ├── manuscripts
│   ├── posters
│   └── presentations
├── documentation
└── misc
```

Please note that this is not the only possible way to structure a research project, but it might help you finding a good folder structure for yourself.

## Using the template

### 1) Download

You can download this folder structure on GitHub via `Code` -> `Download ZIP` (see screenshot below) or by cloning the repository. Of course you can also fork this repository and by that create a new research project repository for yourself :wink:.

### 2) Edit this README

The README should contain the information about your research project. For more information on writing good READMEs, please check out [the README chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-repo/project-repo-readme.html?highlight=readme) of The Turing Way book.

### 3) Adjust to your needs

Add folders that you need and remove those that you don't need.

### 4) Add your files

Add your files to the folders.
